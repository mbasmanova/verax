## License

## Getting Started

### Get the Source

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/facebookincubator/axiom.git
cd axiom
```

If you already cloned without `--recursive`, initialize the Velox submodule:

```
git submodule sync --recursive
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### System Requirements

Axiom requires a C++20 compiler. Supported platforms:

- **Linux**: Ubuntu 22.04+ with gcc 11+ (tested up to gcc 14) or clang 15+
- **macOS**: macOS 13+ with Apple Clang 15+ (Xcode 15+)

### Setting up Dependencies

Axiom uses Velox's dependency setup scripts. On macOS, dependencies are
installed to `deps-install/` by default. Set `INSTALL_PREFIX` to control
the installation directory:

```
export INSTALL_PREFIX=$(pwd)/deps-install
```

Then run the appropriate script for your platform:

**macOS:**

```
VELOX_BUILD_SHARED=ON PROMPT_ALWAYS_RESPOND=y velox/scripts/setup-macos.sh
```

**Ubuntu:**

```
VELOX_BUILD_SHARED=ON PROMPT_ALWAYS_RESPOND=y velox/scripts/setup-ubuntu.sh
```

`VELOX_BUILD_SHARED=ON` ensures dependencies are built for shared linking,
which is required by the Velox mono library used in Axiom.

### Building

On macOS, pass the path to the installed dependencies via `EXTRA_CMAKE_FLAGS`:

```
EXTRA_CMAKE_FLAGS="-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(pwd)/deps-install" make debug
```

Other build targets:

```
make release                        # optimized build
make unittest                       # build and run tests
```

### Running Tests

```
ctest --test-dir _build/debug -j 8 --output-on-failure
```

To run a subset of test executables, use `-R` with a regex. Add `-N`
to list matching tests without running them.

```
ctest --test-dir _build/debug -R axiom_optimizer      # run all optimizer tests
ctest --test-dir _build/debug -R axiom_cli_test       # run CLI tests only
```

To run individual test cases within an executable, use `--gtest_filter`:

```
_build/debug/axiom/optimizer/tests/axiom_optimizer_tests --gtest_filter="AggregationPlanTest.*"
```

### Try the CLI

The interactive SQL CLI runs queries against an in-memory TPC-H dataset:

```
_build/debug/axiom/cli/axiom_sql
```

```
SQL> select count(*) from nation;
ROW<count:BIGINT>
-----
count
-----
   25
(1 rows in 1 batches)
```

### Query Your Own Data

The [Hive connector](axiom/connectors/hive/README.md) can query Parquet,
DWRF, and CSV files on the local filesystem. Each subdirectory under the
data path is treated as a table.

#### Parquet Files

For Parquet (and DWRF) files, use `axiom_import` to auto-infer schema and
compute statistics from file headers.

The example below uses the [NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission Trip Record
Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) — a
public dataset of ~3 million yellow taxi trips from January 2024 (~50 MB).

**1. Download the data:**

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/nyc_taxi/trips
curl -o /tmp/nyc_taxi/trips/yellow_tripdata_2024-01.parquet \
  https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2024-01.parquet
```

**2. Import (generate `.schema` and `.stats` metadata):**

```bash
_build/debug/axiom/cli/axiom_import --data_path /tmp/nyc_taxi
```

```
Importing 1 table(s) from '/tmp/nyc_taxi' (format: parquet)
  trips ... done (0.42s)
Import complete.
```

**3. Query:**

```bash
_build/debug/axiom/cli/axiom_sql --data_path /tmp/nyc_taxi
```

```
SQL> SELECT count(*) FROM trips;
-------
  count
-------
2964624

SQL> SELECT passenger_count, avg(total_amount) AS avg_total
     FROM trips GROUP BY 1;
----------------+-----------
passenger_count | avg_total
----------------+-----------
              1 |     26.21
              2 |     29.52
              3 |     29.14
...
```

To add more months, download additional files into the same `trips/`
directory and re-run `axiom_import`.

#### CSV Files

For CSV files, create the table with schema first, then copy the files in.

**1. Create the data directory and the table with schema:**

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/my_data
_build/debug/axiom/cli/axiom_sql --data_path /tmp/my_data --data_format text \
  --query "CREATE TABLE sales (id INTEGER, name VARCHAR, amount DOUBLE)
           WITH (file_format = 'text', \"field.delim\" = ',')"
```

**2. Copy CSV files into the table directory:**

```bash
cp data.csv /tmp/my_data/sales/
```

Optionally, run `axiom_import` to collect column statistics for the
optimizer:

```bash
_build/debug/axiom/cli/axiom_import --data_path /tmp/my_data --data_format text
```

**3. Query:**

```bash
_build/debug/axiom/cli/axiom_sql --data_path /tmp/my_data --data_format text
```

```
SQL> SELECT * FROM sales;
---+-------+-------
id | name  | amount
---+-------+-------
 1 | Alice |  100.5
 2 | Bob   |    200
 3 | Carol | 150.75
```

## Code Organization

Axiom is a set of reusable and extensible components designed to be compatible
with Velox. These components are:

- [SQL Parser](axiom/sql/presto/README.md) compatible with PrestoSQL dialect.
  - top-level “sql” directory
- Logical Plan - a representation of SQL relations and expressions.
  - top-level “logical_plan” directory
- Cost-based [Optimizer](axiom/optimizer/README.md) compatible with Velox
  execution.
  - top-level “optimizer” directory
- Query Runner capable of orchestrating multi-stage Velox execution.
  - top-level “runner” directory
- Connector - an extention of Velox Connector APIs to provide functionality
  necessary for query parsing and planning.
  - top-level “connectors” directory
  - [Hive](axiom/connectors/hive/README.md) — Local filesystem connector for Parquet, DWRF, and TEXT (including CSV) files.
  - [TPC-H](axiom/connectors/tpch/README.md) — Read-only, in-memory TPC-H benchmark data.
  - [Test](axiom/connectors/tests/README.md) — In-memory read-write connector for unit testing.
- [CLI](axiom/cli/README.md) - Interactive SQL command line for executing
  queries against in-memory TPC-H dataset and local Hive data.
  - top-level “cli” directory

These components can be used to put together single-node or distributed
execution. Single-node execution can be single-threaded or multi-threaded.

The query processing flow goes like this:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph p[Parser & Analyzer]
        sql["`SQL
        (PrestoSQL, SparkSQL, PostgresSQL, etc.)`"]
        df["`Dataframe
        (PySpark)`"]
        sql --> lp[Logical Plan]
        df --> lp
    end

    subgraph o[Optimizer]
        lp --> qg[Query Graph]
        qg --> plan[Physical Plan]
        plan --> velox[Velox Multi-Fragment Plan]
    end
```

SQL Parser parses the query into Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), then resolves names
and types to produce a Logical Plan. The Optimizer takes a Logical Plan and
produces an optimized executable multi-fragment Velox plan. Finally, LocalRunner
creates and executed Velox tasks to produce a query result.

EXPLAIN command can be used to print an optimized multi-fragment Velox plan
without executing it.

```
SQL> explain  select count(*) from nation;
Fragment 0: stage1 numWorkers=4:
-- PartitionedOutput[2][SINGLE Presto] -> count:BIGINT
  -- Aggregation[1][PARTIAL count := count()] -> count:BIGINT
    -- TableScan[0][table: nation, scale factor: 0.01] ->
       Estimate: 25 rows, 0B peak memory

Fragment 1:  numWorkers=1:
-- Aggregation[5][FINAL count := count("count")] -> count:BIGINT
  -- LocalPartition[4][GATHER] -> count:BIGINT
    -- Exchange[3][Presto] -> count:BIGINT
       Input Fragment 0
```

EXPLAIN ANALYZE command can be used to execute the query and print Velox plan
annotated with runtime statistics.

```
SQL> explain analyze select count(*) from nation;
