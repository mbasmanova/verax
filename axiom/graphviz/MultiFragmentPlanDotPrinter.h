/// Generates a DOT language representation of a MultiFragmentPlan for
/// visualization with Graphviz.
///
/// Each fragment is rendered as a labeled box containing:
///   - The fragment's output distribution (e.g. hash[k1, k2], broadcast,
///     arbitrary, gather) read from the root PartitionedOutputNode.
///   - The fragment header: task prefix, FragmentType, and task width.
///   - The fragment's Velox plan tree, indented to preserve structure,
///     with node type names only. ProjectNode nodes and the root
///     PartitionedOutputNode are skipped as structural noise.
///
/// Edges between fragments connect each producer fragment to its consumer
/// fragment. The consumer's Exchange row in the body is annotated with the
/// producer's task prefix so the reader can match incoming edges to the
/// receiving Exchange.
///
/// Usage:
///   std::ofstream file("plan.dot");
///   MultiFragmentPlanDotPrinter::print(plan, file);
///
/// Then render with: dot -Tsvg plan.dot -o plan.svg
