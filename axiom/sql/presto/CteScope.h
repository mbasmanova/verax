/// Resolves CTE names while parsing one query. As the parser descends
/// through nested WITH clauses, tracks what each in-scope name refers to.

/// A table name resolves in order:
///   1. the recursive anchor, if inside a recursive CTE's step body;
///   2. the in-scope CTE binding;
///   3. otherwise a base table (resolved by the caller).
///
/// Bindings stack per name: a nested WITH that reuses a name pushes a
/// binding on top of the enclosing one, which reappears when the nested
/// scope is popped. That is what lets a non-recursive CTE's own body
/// resolve a same-name reference to the enclosing CTE -- the body hides
/// only its own binding.
///
/// Usage:
///   auto scope = ctes.enterScope();   // once per query body
///   ctes.bind(name, {withQuery, isRecursive, definingScope});
///   if (auto hidden = ctes.hide(name)) { translate hidden.entry()'s body }
