# Optimizer

The optimizer turns a logical plan (`logical_plan::LogicalPlanNode`) into a
`MultiFragmentPlan` of Velox plan nodes. It translates the logical plan into
the Node IR, runs a sequence of passes over that IR, chooses join order and
data distribution, and emits executable fragments. The
[pass cheat sheet](docs/OptimizerPasses.md) maps each optimization to the pass
that owns it.

The optimizer's code is under `v2/`. The previous optimizer, built on
`DerivedTable`, is legacy; its design is documented under
[docs/v1](docs/v1/Overview.md).

## Terminology

Fanout
: Join fanout or one-to-many join refers to a situation where one row in a table joins to multiple rows in another table. This means the number of rows in the joined result set can be greater than the number of rows in the primary (left) table.

Theta join
: A join whose condition relates the two inputs with something other than key equality, e.g. `t.a < u.b`. With no equi-keys to hash on, it runs as a nested loop join. In a distributed plan, one input is broadcast; a full join gathers both inputs onto one task.

Conjunction
: A statement formed by adding two statements with the connector AND. Individual statements are called conjuncts.

Disjunction
: A statement formed by adding two statements with the connector OR. Individual statements are called disjuncts.

Negation
: A statement formed by adding a NOT to a statement.

> [!NOTE]
> De Morgan's Laws:
> * Negation of a conjunction: The negation of an AND statement is equivalent to the OR of the individual negations.
>   * not(a AND b) <==> not(a) OR not(b)
> * Negation of a disjunction: The negation of an OR statement is equivalent to the AND of the individual negations.
>   * not(a OR b) <==> not(a) AND not(b)

## Abbreviations

XxxP
: Raw pointer to Xxx: XxxP := Xxx*

XxxCP
: Raw pointer to constant Xxx: XxxCP := const Xxx*. Remember to place 'const' *after* the type: XxxCP const variableName. (const XxxCP doesn't produce the desired effect.)

XxxVector
: Standard vector of raw pointers to Xxx allocated from the arena: XxxVector := `QGVector<XxxP>`.

CPSpan<T>
: A view on an array of const raw pointers `CPSpan<T> := std::span<const T* const>`;

LRFanout
: Left-to-Right Fanout. The average number of right side rows selected for one row on the left.

RLFanout
: Right-to-Left Fanout. The average number of left side rows selected for one row on the right.

## Memory Management

Node IR nodes and expressions are allocated from the arena of the optimization's `QueryGraphContext` and have the lifetime of the optimization. They are dropped wholesale at the end without invoking destructors. The candidate plans DPhyp builds during join enumeration (`MemoOp`) are allocated with malloc and owned by the memo through `std::unique_ptr`.

QGAllocator
: STL compatible allocator that manages std:: containers allocated in the QueryGraphContext arena. Use `make<T>(<args>)` to allocate a new object of type T from the arena.

Name
: Pointer to an arena allocated interned copy of a null terminated string. Used for identifiers. Allows comparing strings by comparing pointers. `Name := const char*`. Use `toName(<string>)` to convert an external string.
