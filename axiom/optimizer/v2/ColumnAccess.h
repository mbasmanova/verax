/// Records which parts of each column a query reads, so that a scan can ask

///   NodeCP rewrite(NodeCP node, PushdownContext& context) override {

/// An expression is decomposed into a column and a path when it is a chain of
/// struct dereferences and constant subscripts: `m[1].x` reads `[1].x` of `m`.
/// A chain rooted at anything else contributes the whole of every column it
/// reaches, which is the current behavior of every read and therefore always
/// safe. Note that an unrecognized call gives up only its own result: its
/// arguments are still decomposed, so `f(m[1].x)` still reads one key and one
/// field.
///
/// Absence of a column is not "reads nothing" — a column never passed to
/// `add` has no entry, and `subfieldsOf` reports the whole column for it.
///
/// A node that produces a column from an expression -- a projection, a union
/// leg -- composes the paths its consumers read with that expression.
/// Elsewhere a path is recorded against the column the expression reads rather
/// than the one it produces, which yields a prefix of the true path. A prefix
/// covers the paths below it, so an uncomposed read is wider than needed and
/// never narrower — which is what lets the nodes that rename columns leave
/// composition alone.
///
/// The caller must hold to all of:
///  - `add(const Node&)` runs on each node from the root down, so a node
///    producing a column is reached after the consumers whose paths it
///    extends.
///  - The expressions a pass may prune — a Project's, an Aggregate's — are
///    recorded by that pass from what it keeps, not by `add(const Node&)`.
///  - A subtree the descent has yet to reach, but whose reads a Scan above it
///    will serve, is recorded first with `addSubtree`.
