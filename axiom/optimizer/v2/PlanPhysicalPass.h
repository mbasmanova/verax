  /// Returns the distributed physical plan for `root`. In one bottom-up walk it
  /// chooses cost-based join order (DPhyp over maximal chains of reorderable
  /// equi-joins) and the distribution of aggregations and order/limit
  /// operators, inserting remote exchanges so each operator's input satisfies
  /// its required partitioning.
  ///
  /// Automatic fallbacks preserve operators that cannot be safely reordered.
  /// When DPhyp cannot cost an inner-join cluster, the fallback retains
  /// relation order except that it takes an equi-joinable relation before
  /// introducing a cross join. Available size estimates choose the build side.
  /// At `numWorkers > 1`, broadcast, repartition, or gather exchanges provide a
  /// valid distributed input combination.
  ///
  /// When `options.syntacticJoinOrder` is true, cost-based reordering is
  /// disabled and every join keeps both the tree and input orientation written
  /// in the query.
  /// `options.dphypEnumerationBudget` caps DPhyp's enumeration before it falls
  /// back to greedy join ordering; <= 0 means unlimited. `numWorkers` is the
  /// target task count; when > 1 the walk generates remote-exchange candidates
  /// so operators co-partition, gather, or broadcast their inputs. `numDrivers`
  /// is the per-worker driver (local pipeline) count; when > 1, an aggregate
  /// whose input is already co-located on its grouping keys still needs a local
  /// exchange to bring each group to one driver, so it two-stages (partial →
  /// local exchange → final). `numWorkers` and `numDrivers` are per-plan
  /// properties, not `OptimizerOptions` fields, so they are passed separately.
  /// `evaluator` folds constants exposed while projection expressions merge.
