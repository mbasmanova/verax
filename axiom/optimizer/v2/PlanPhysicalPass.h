  /// Returns the distributed physical plan for `root`. In one bottom-up walk it

  /// operators, inserting remote exchanges so each operator's input satisfies
  /// its required partitioning.
  ///
  /// Cross joins, theta and decorrelated-subquery joins, and joins whose keys
  /// do not resolve to leaf columns keep their written shape; at
  /// `numWorkers > 1` they still get a valid distributed input combination
  /// (broadcast build).
  ///
  /// When `options.syntacticJoinOrder` is true, cost-based reordering is
  /// disabled and every join keeps the order written in the query. The same
  /// query-order fallback also kicks in per cluster when DPhyp produces no
  /// valid costable plan.
  /// `options.dphypEnumerationBudget` caps DPhyp's enumeration before it falls
  /// back to greedy join ordering; <= 0 means unlimited. `numWorkers` is the
  /// target task count; when > 1 the walk generates remote-exchange candidates
  /// so operators co-partition, gather, or broadcast their inputs. `numDrivers`
  /// is the per-worker driver (local pipeline) count; when > 1, an aggregate
  /// whose input is already co-located on its grouping keys still needs a local
  /// exchange to bring each group to one driver, so it two-stages (partial →
  /// local exchange → final). `numWorkers` and `numDrivers` are per-plan
  /// properties, not `OptimizerOptions` fields, so they are passed separately.
