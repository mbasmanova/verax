/// Single top-down pass over the tree IR that does two intertwined jobs in one
/// traversal:
///
///  - Filter pushdown. Each `Filter`'s conjuncts are flattened into a `pending`
///    set carried down the tree. At every node, conjuncts the node's rule
///    allows continue downward; a conjunct that cannot pass is re-emitted as a
///    `Filter` immediately above that node. Input `Filter` nodes thus dissolve
///    and reappear as low as each conjunct can legally go.
///  - Column pruning. A `required` column set is carried down from `root`'s
///    output schema. Each node narrows its `outputColumns` to what consumers
///    above still read, and drops the projections, aggregates, window
///    functions, and union legs that produce only unused columns.
///
/// Both jobs share one traversal state (the internal `PushdownContext`):
/// `pending` conjuncts, the `required` / `requiredAbove` column sets, and
/// `nonNullColumns` (columns an ancestor inner join proves non-NULL).
///
/// Notable per-node behavior:
///  - Join places each conjunct on the left input, the right input, or the
///    join itself, and demotes an outer join to inner (or full to left/right)
///    when a pending conjunct or a proven-non-NULL column rejects nulls on a
///    padded side. It also fuses a consuming mark filter into a
///    `kLeftSemiProject` join.
///  - Window pushes conjuncts that reference only partition keys below the
///    window (the rest stay above), prunes window functions no consumer reads,
///    and specializes a single ranking function (row_number / rank /
///    dense_rank) into the cheapest node that computes it: an unordered
///    `row_number` becomes a `RowNumber`, and an ordered ranking becomes a
///    `TopNRowNumber` when a bound caps each partition. That bound comes from a
///    `rankColumn <op> n` predicate, which is consumed, or from a `Limit` /
///    `TopN` above the window, which stays.
///  - `Apply` must already be gone: decorrelate removes every `Apply` before
///    this pass, so encountering one is a logic error.
///
/// Post-condition: every conjunct that reaches a `Scan` is offered to the
/// connector. The ones it takes go into the `ScanHandle` the `Scan` points at.
/// The ones it rejects stay in a single `Filter` directly above the `Scan`,
/// which then also outputs the columns they read, narrowed by a `Project` when
/// nothing above wants them and the consumer is not itself a `Project`. A
/// rewrite running after this pass sees the nodes the query will run.
