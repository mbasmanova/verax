/// replicates a side to every task while the other side stays partitioned, so a
/// preserved side must be the partitioned one or its rows would be emitted on
/// every task. The right side is preserved by RIGHT / FULL outer joins and by
/// right semi joins; for those the build cannot be broadcast, and the mirror
/// orientation broadcasts the other side instead.

/// over the whole build input: a broadcast copy would give every task the full

///     the lowest eligible join. `nullAware` and `nullAsValue` are
///     unused.
///   - Outer equi-join (LEFT / RIGHT / FULL). `filter` carries the
///     ON-clause non-equi conjuncts bound to this edge — moving them
///     above would let null-padded rows pass through, changing
///     semantics. `nullAware` and `nullAsValue` carry Velox null
///     semantics.
///   - Unnest. Built by `JoinEdge::unnest`. `left` covers the
///     relations whose subtree feeds the Unnest; `right` is the
///     single Unnest relation. No equi-keys, no filter;
///     `isUnnest()` discriminates. Unlike the other flavors this
///     edge never becomes a join: an Unnest expands the rows of the
///     relations on `left` rather than pairing two inputs, so DPhyp
///     lowers it to a unary `UnnestOp` over whichever plan covers
///     `left`. The edge states connectivity and ordering — the
///     Unnest relation is reachable only through it, so no plan
///     holds that relation without the relations it expands.
///
/// Invariants:
///   - `left` and `right` are non-empty and disjoint.
///   - Equi-join flavors: `leftKeys.size() == rightKeys.size()` and
///     is non-empty.
///   - Unnest flavor: `leftKeys` / `rightKeys` / `filter` empty;
///     `joinType == kInner`.
