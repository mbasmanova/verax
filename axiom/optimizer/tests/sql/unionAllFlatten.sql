-- Tests for UNION ALL single-child collapse (flattenDt).
-- Each test uses a CTE with a specific layer, wraps it in UNION ALL with a
-- constant boolean column, and applies an outer WHERE that eliminates one leg.
-- Filter pushdown removes the constant-false leg, leaving a single child that
-- gets flattened into the parent. The tests verify that column reconstruction
-- during flattening preserves correctness.
--
-- See docs/DerivedTableLayers.md for the DT layer model.
